        <h1><center><br>HISTORY<br><br><hr></center></h1>
        <a class="hisd"><center><br>Before Quezon City was known as the City of Stars, it was founded out of a visionary desire to establish a well-functioning city.
            It all started in the early 20th century when former President Manuel L Quezon noticed how Manila, the capital of the Philippines, was getting crowded and it was an easy target to bomb naval guns of the country’s opponents at the time. This is because it was near the bay. He wanted to create a city that would replace Manila as the national capital of the Philippines. He pursued the idea of building a completely new city at least 15 km from Manila Bay, beyond the reach of aerial weapons.
            Before the city was born, it consisted of small individual towns of San Francisco del Monte, Novaliches, and Balintawak. After the Philippine authorities approved of the project, the process started in 1938 when Quezon contacted his American friend, William E. Parsons, who is an experienced architect to help plan the development of the site where the new city will be built. He contributed to the selection of the Diliman estate. Unfortunately, Parsons passed away the same year, therefore a person with the same set of skills has to take over, and it was his partner Harry Frost.
            By October 12, 1939, the city was officially incorporated. However Quezon’s desire to make the city the new national capital took years to be fulfilled. Nevertheless, President Elpidio Quirino proclaimed Quezon City to be the national capital on July 17, 1948, defining the area of the city to be 156.60 square kilometers or 60 square miles.
            After years of being the capital, on November 7, 1975, during Ferdinand Marcos’s government, the proclamation of Presidential Decree No. 824 created Metro Manila. This resulted in Quezon City to be one of the 17 cities and municipalities of Metro Manila. The next year of June, Presidential Decree No. 940 moved the national capital back to Manila as what we know today.
            Quezon City is the first local government in the Philippines to have a computerized real estate appraisal and payment system. In 2015, the City Government developed a database system that includes around 400,000 property units with the capacity to record payments.
            Currently, QC stands with four political districts.</center></a>
