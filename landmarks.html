        <p><center>A lot of people in Metro Manila seem to forget about this massive park in Quezon City, mainly because it is already surrounded by bigger and more prominent attractions.

Aside from the thriving flora and fauna within the centre, there’s also a fishing village, tea house, amphitheatre and several picnic areas.</center></p>
